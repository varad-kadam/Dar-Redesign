                    five-metre smart bridge, the latest outcome of a ground-breaking research project that has focused
                    on using generative design, 3D printing, robotics, and artificial intelligence to make the
                    construction industry safer, more sustainable, more intelligent, and more efficient. </p>
                <p>
                    Building on the success of the 2-metre Smart Bridge, the five-metre bridge empowered the research
                    team to experiment with improved printing practices and recycled materials, test the possibility of
                    printing in-situ with robots on construction sites and refine the process of creating intelligent
                    infrastructure. The project's objective was to test printing workflows, technologies, and innovative
                    materials to facilitate sustainable and effective 3D printing for buildings, bridges and large-scale
                    infrastructure in the future

                <p class="lead">Between 1981 and 2016, the Cunene Province – home to over one million people in South
                    Angola – endured no fewer than six episodes of drought. Particularly devastating were the three
                    drought disasters of 1989, 2012, and 2014. Heavily associated with climate change, these droughts
                    collectively led to the deaths of many people by 2016. Moreover, in a primarily agricultural and
                    pastoral region, the drought had wide-ranging destructive impacts on agriculture and livestock
                    sectors; existing water tables could not be replenished in sufficient quantities to maintain the
                    bodies of water, and community members losing upward thousands heads of cattle. The droughts also
                    left far-reaching societal impacts – from a sharp increase in domestic violence to an increased use
                    of child labour and the associated school drop-out and absenteeism rates to a rural exodus.</p>

                    monitor the situation in the Cunene Province in real time; acquiring, distributing, and installing
                    plastic tanks to serve rural communities without access to water; and working with local societies
                    and businessmen to mobilise tanker trucks to aid people in those regions most affected by the
                    drought. However, with the devastating losses and the expanding threat of climate change, there is a
                    pressing need for a sustainable, long-term solution.

                <p class="lead">Climate change is one of the greatest challenges currently facing our global
                    communities. And experts concur that only a visionary, far-reaching drive to achieve net zero global
                    emissions by 2050 can offer hope for a sustainable and bright future.</p>
                <p>At the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26), objectives were set out to secure global net zero by
                    2050 in order to keep climate change to within the tolerable 1.5 degrees. COP26 is calling for an
                    altogether greater level of global and local collaboration. 74 countries, accounting for more than
                    80 percent of global GDP and 70 percent of global CO2 emissions, have put net-zero commitments in
                    place. They are joined by over 700 cities and 3,000 companies that have made net-zero commitments as
                    part of the United Nation’s “Race to Zero” campaign.</p>
                <p>A recent report, prepared in collaboration with our international Dar Group and our partner the World
                    Green Building Council, stated that the built environment – comprising both buildings and the
                    infrastructure that supports community life – must be on a clear path to decarbonise by 2050, with
                    significant progress by 2030. The council also stated that we cannot decarbonise buildings without
                    infrastructure and called for a more closely aligned approach to sustainable buildings and
                    infrastructure, in pursuit of shared climate and sustainability ambitions.</p>

                <p>All over the world, invaluable and irreplaceable species of flora and fauna are going extinct at an
                    alarming rate. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which has been monitoring
                    the status of species throughout the years, publishes the Red List of Threatened Species,
                    classifying a staggering 8,400 species of wild fauna and flora as critically endangered, and
                    approximately 30,000 more as endangered and/or vulnerable.</p>
                <p>The World Wildlife Fund paints an even darker picture, warning that we are facing the biggest
                    extinction event since the end of the dinosaur era, with a million more species at risk of becoming
                    extinct within the next few decades.</p>

                <p class="lead">As countries around the world set ambitious net zero energy commitments in order to
                    avert the most catastrophic effects of climate change, it becomes crucial to focus on mitigating the
                    carbon emissions of sectors that play a major role in everyday life and have correspondingly higher
                    impacts on the environment. The water sector is one of those. Though many of us do not immediately
                    associate water with carbon emissions, the process of extracting and transferring water for domestic
                    or industrial use has significant embodied carbon. Such a predicament poses a real concern, as water
                    remains the lifeline of any society and the demand for this resource continues to grow. In this
                    article, Ibrahim Kronfol, the 2022 Vice President of the LEED Technical Advisory Group for Water
                    Efficiency, discusses the hidden energy costs of water use and the focus of the water efficiency
                    LEED unit for 2022.</p>
                <p>Energy is embodied in the water we use, and it drives every part of the water use cycle: from
                    extraction, through treatment and transfer, to discharge. Figure 1 shows the water use cycle as a
                    cyclic multi-step process with two separate potable and sewage water streams. Each of the water
                    transfer or treatment stages is associated with an average energy use bill, collectively adding up
                    to a considerable energy consumption rate for every cubic metre of water we use.</p>
